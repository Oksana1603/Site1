    <h1 style="text-align:center">Are you an introvert?</h1> 
    <p>The terms extravert/intovert have been first introduced by <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/carl-jung.html" target="_blank">Carl Jung</a>, second most famous Austrian psychologist.<b>Introverts</b> <i>(or those of us with introverted tendencies)</i>  tend to recharge by spending time alone. They lose <em>energy</em> from being around people for long periods of <strong>time</strong>, particularly large crowds.

<b>Extroverts</b>, on the other hand, <i>gain energy from other people.</i> They <strong>recharge</strong> by being social.</p>
